# Goals for Evaluation

The final step in the ADDIE process is to determine whether your students have achieved the specific goals established in the __Analysis__ stage. In practice, evaluation is an ongoing process. At some point though, you as the instructor need to compile the data collected and decide which learning outcomes students are meeting adequately vs. which outcomes they are not meeting. The answer to the latter question will inform the process of revision, which goes back to the design and develop phase of the process.

Specific questions to ask include:

1. What questions did I come up with based on the analysis stage? Does the evaluation process provide sufficient data to answer those questions with confidence?
2. Are students reaching the end goals of the course overall? That were set in the design and development phase?
3. Is the implementation process working as expected? Where are students getting confused or off track? Are they able to self-correct?
