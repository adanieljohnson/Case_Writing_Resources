# Goals for Implementation

This stage of the ADDIE process is similar to Design and Development in that there will always be some ongoing redesign as the studen population changes, course goals change, or other course elements become more or less important. 

One strategy for making implementation less difficult is to design cases __assuming__ that you will need to modify them in the future. Treat cases as course modules that can be edited or removed without unduly impacting other cases or activities. This becomes more difficult if you have two or more linked cases that come back to the same model system several times.

Specific questions to ask related to implementation include:

1. How will the case and related materials be delivered?
2. How will students complete and submit case work and assessments?
3. How will the instructor provide support for the case in progress? Adjust or modify the case? Guide students through the process?
