## Resources & Tools

* __Diagnostic Questions Clusters (DCQ)__
    + Cases with linked sets of questions based on the concepts inventory model. The questions are designed to uncover student misconceptions and thinking processes.
    + The original sets of cases and questions focus on ecology, but other groups have developed DCQs for other topics; search the web for examples. 
    + Use the original sets as examples to develop new DCQ-type questions that are specific to your situation and goals.

* __Passage-Based Multiple Choice Questions__
    + The SAT, ACT, and most professional entrance exams use passage-based questions to test higher-level thinking skills.
    + AAMCAS, Educational Testing Service, and other testing agencies prohibt reuse of their sample questions, but the samples illustrate how multiple choice questions can test more than content knowledge.

* __NSF Pre-proposal Project__
    + A multi-week project in which student teams write a simplified NSF grant pre-proposal. 
    + Students must apply content knowledge, core concepts, and evidence-based thinking strategies gained from multiple cases completed during the semester. 
    + [Assignment Guide](downloads/NSF_preproposal_guide.md)
    + [Sample preproposal](downloads/Example_Preproposal.docx)
    + [Grading rubric](downloads/Preproposal_rubric.docx)

* __Explainer Video Project__
    + A multi-week project in which student teams create a video for a general audience that explains a concept NOT covered in course content. 
    + Students must identify essential information then create a logical structure for presenting that information.
    + Teams cannot rely on the instructor's logic structure because videos must explain a topic not covered in class.
