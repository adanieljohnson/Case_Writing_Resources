HOW TO WRITE CASES
Getting Inspiration
Kip Herreid, the founder of the National Clearinghouse for Case Studies Teaching in Science (NCCSTS), always says, “to write a case, start with a story.” You may have a specific story in mind that you want to build a case around. If not, these three exercises can get your mental juices flowing.

Applied Thinking - Daily News:
As professionals we read and process news differently than our students. Pick a story published in the last 24 hours that is relevant to an open question in your field or to a topic that you think students should understand better but do not currently. That story is the starting point for writing your case.

Making Connections - Trigger Points:
Pick a major event or change in your discipline. Now pick one seemingly minor event, development, or other factor that CONTRIBUTED to the bigger event. How that earlier event contributed to the latter one is the starting point for writing your case.

Teaching Challenge - Specific Skill:
Pick a teaching challenge you run into regularly. It can be a skill you want students to develop more fully, or a recurring problem (citing sources, for example). Addressing that one skills gap is the starting point for your case.


A Starting Template For Developing a Case
If you write cases regularly, you develop a workflow that works for you. Until then, or if you have been away from case writing for a while, it helps to have a starting template. The one below will help you assemble the essential first pieces while still leaving plenty of room for creativity.

1.  Goals and Topic: 
What 1-2 learning goals do you want this case to achieve? Be specific. Use action verbs to state the goals.
•	
•	

What topic do you want to make your case about? WHY use that topic?
•	


2.  Scenario: 
What story or situation that is relevant or familiar to students would require them to use or demonstrate the knowledge or skills that are contained in your learning goals? 
•	Can you break the story up into segments with separate goals?
•	Can you organize the scenario so it contains an “and-but-so” conflict or problem?
•	What visuals or artifacts could help bring the story to life for students?


3.  Guide Questions and Supports:
What initial questions can you ask students about this scenario that will require them to use a particular thinking strategy or apply a particular set of skills? If they do not have those skills yet, what questions would you ask to lead them through that process? 

Ideally your questions:
•	Are open-ended (no clear single best answer)
•	Can be discussed, explored in a small group of 2-6 students
•	Require higher order thinking skills (no simple answers)
•	Get students to think or act in ways that fit the learning goals

What is the MINIMUM amount of supporting information they need? How much would overwhelm them?

What follow-up questions can you ask that require students to apply or extend what they have learned in the discussion? Ideally these questions:
•	Require using or building on the initial information surfaced by the first set of questions
•	At least partly “close the loop”
•	Get students to think or act in ways that fit the learning goals

 
4.  Outputs
How are you going to ask students to provide responses to questions or feedback?
•	Show of hands
•	Group reporter
•	Color cards
•	Electronic poll
•	Clickers

What will be your students’ deliverables that you will grade?
•	Team items
•	Individual items


5.  Logistics
What is you plan for running the case?
•	How will you introduce the case?
•	What size groups will you have? Self-selected or assigned?
•	How long do you want the case to take?
•	How will you close out the scenario, and move to the next topic?

What is you plan for WHEN things go astray?
•	How can you shorten the case if time runs out?
•	What technology do you need that could fail?
•	What is your Plan B if students don’t “get it”?


Refining Your Case
Now you have a skeleton for a case that you can continue working on after the workshop. Before you do much more work, read the supplemental handout. It has suggestions for how you might organize and structure your idea as you turn it into a usable case.  Also look at the sample cases for ideas on how to structure yours.

Once you have a rough idea of what your case will look like, outline it to a colleague and 1-2 students to see what they think. If you still like your idea, you are ready to start writing!

General Advice

Remember that students perform to our expectations. 

* Students will rise to meet high but realistic expectations (the Rosenthal Effect), _provided they are given the resources needed (enabled), motivated to succeed (engaged), and coached through the process properly._ 
* Conversely, if we have lower expectations of students, or they have low expectations of themselves, they will perform poorly (the Golem Effect).

Make your cases emotionally engaging. Our cognitive processes are wired to place more value on information, events, etc., linked to high arousal states (fear, anger, joy.)  What students learn while in those mental states is more likely to stay with them. 

* Have fun with your cases. Humor is easiest arousal state to manage because it is a positive experience. The case itself does not need to be humorous (though it can be), but make the discussion process a positive experience. 
* Sad stories also can produce strong links, IF used carefully. 
* Cases often have conflicts that must be resolved. Be careful that the conflict does not create fear or anger. These can make students shut down, or get off track.

USING ENGAGEMENT TO ANCHOR YOUR TEACHING STRATEGY: BIO783
Bybee’s 5E Model of Teaching for Engaged Learners
The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) is a non-profit organization in Colorado Springs, Colorado that develops curriculum materials, provides professional development for the science education community, and conducts research and evaluation on curriculum reform. In 1987, Executive Director Rodger W. Bybee and his colleagues developed the 5E Instructional Model (to learn more, go to https://bscs.org/bscs-5e-instructional-model.)

It is a constructivist model with 5 stages: Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. Studies of the model have shown there to be significant improvements in conceptual learning, skills development, as well as greater interest in science by students. One reason it is so successful is that engagement is an explicit element in the instructional design. 

This is how the stages are implemented.

Engage: 
A task or problem is introduced. It can include a demonstration of an event, the presentation of a phenomenon or problem or asking pointed questions. The goal is to focus the learners' attention on the tasks that will follow, connect to past learning and experiences, and spark learners’ interest and involvement. 

Explore: 
Learners take part in activities that allow them to work with materials that give them a 'hands on' experience of the phenomena being observed. Simulations or models whose parameter can be manipulated by learners, so that they can build relevant experiences of the phenomena, can be provided. Questioning, sharing and communication with other learners should be encouraged during this stage. The teacher facilitates the process.

Explain: 
The focus at this stage is on analysis, not just content dissemination. Depending on the topic, learning goals, and group, the instructor may choose to introduce explanations and give definitions, mediate discussions or simply facilitate by helping learners find the words needed. Learners should be encouraged to use new language or terms to describe and understand their own observations, questions, hypotheses and experiences. Communication between learners and learner groups can spur the process.

Elaborate/Extend:
Using the understanding gained in the previous stages, now learners should be encouraged build and expand upon it. Inferences, deductions, and hypotheses can be applied to similar or real-world situations. Varied examples and applications of concepts learned strengthen mental models and provide further insight and understanding.
Evaluate:
In reality, evaluation will occur at all stages  as formative assessment), in order to determine that learning objectives have been met and misconceptions avoided. 

5E in Action: A Sample Teaching Outline
This is an example of a lecture outline from a graduate teaching course. The lecture introduces constructivism, one of the foundation principles for the course. Even though the concept is important, not all graduate students take the time needed to think about it deeply. The 5E format works well in this situation to maximize engagement and deepen thinking. 

1. Engage first:
•	Tell story of Richard Feynman’s iconic Lectures on Physics series (1961–63). Intellectual masterpieces, but still had major course dropout and lack of UG attendance. Failed to change course grades. 
•	First engagement question. What went wrong? 
Use the class’ ideas to introduce central problem: he did not account for how people learn. 
•	Reiterate central problem with second question: so how do people learn? 
This is our fundamental job, but how do people actually learn? What is the process that is going on? How does knowledge build into a model of the world?

2. Start exploring the question/problem:
•	What are your ideas? 
Write their ideas on the board. Then ask them to comment on each other.

3. Explain/elaborate based on the question or problem:
•	Describe these key points about constructivism.
•	Origins in Jean Piaget and David Ausubel, confirmed by neuroscience
•	Working knowledge is contextual. It exists as learner–dependent mental models that cannot be transmitted unaltered.
•	Mental models include content knowledge & associated thinking skills. An overlying scaffold controls what models we use.
•	Always try to use extant models until they fail.
•	Build multiple provisional models and start testing them. 
•	During provisional stage, learner is particularly open to new ideas, and to reorganizing existing ones.
•	Once one SEEMS to work, it solidifies, and we discard other models.
•	Models that get used again become stronger, models not used fade.

 
4. Extend the exploration to incorporate the explanation/elaboration:
•	What can we predict based on these ideas about learning?
•	Introduce demo video 1: teacher and student in didactic mode. 
•	Pose lead-in question: If constructivism is true, what behaviors do you expect to see from teacher, student? 
•	Show video 1
•	Pose follow–up: when and how do their behaviors, interactions suggest construction of knowledge?
•	Introduce demo video 2: teacher and student in active construction mode. 
•	Pose lead-in question: based on the description, what behaviors do you expect to see from teacher, student in this second clip? 
•	Show video 2
Pose follow–up: when and how do their behaviors, interactions suggest construction of knowledge?

Key points I want them to uncover about didactic teaching with this exploration:
•	There is often no engagement to make understanding important.
•	There is no challenge leading to failure.
•	There is no chance for learners to test provisional models for accuracy.

Key points I want them to uncover about active constructivist teaching with this exploration:
•	Roles of questions as formative feedback.
•	Challenge leading to failure can be a positive experience.
•	How learners test provisional models for accuracy.


5. Evaluate learning gains of students:
•	Discussion: 
What could we change about this teaching moment to improve learning?
•	Homework assignment: 
Go home and explain constructivism to someone.



There are several instruments available that can help faculty identify and prioritize general learning outcomes. Probably the most widely used tool is the Teaching Goals Inventory, developed by Angelo and Cross (1993). According to Angelo and Cross, the Inventory was designed with three purposes: 1) to help faculty choose informal classroom assessment methods; 2) to help individual faculty members become aware of course goals; and 3) to provide a starting point for discussion between colleagues. In practice, the Inventory also has proven extremely useful as a catalyst for new course development, and for analyzing connections between courses in a curricular sequence. The developers have given permission for the Inventory to be used freely, and it is widely available online. 

The Inventory consists of fifty–one general goal statements, each of which can be rated from 1–5. The statements are divided into six major clusters, depending on the kinds of skills each goal fosters. Each individual involved with developing a new course completes the Inventory, basing their rating for each statement on their own personal vision of the new course. The individual results are tallied, then combined to create an overview of the group’s current vision for the course. In addition, the group’s 5–7 highest ranked goals on the Inventory become the working list of general learning outcomes for the new course. Completing the Inventory takes 5–10 minutes, and one individual can tally the results for 5–6 respondents in less than an hour. 
It is essential to understand that the Teaching Goals Inventory only provides a starting point for discussion. It cannot uncover every possible learning outcome, and the language of the general learning outcomes should be modified to reflect the specific course or curriculum. That said, the Inventory is a powerful tool for initiating a curricular discussion, and encouraging faculty to think in general terms before addressing specific details of a single course or course sequence. 
Let’s look once more at the outcomes for the hypothetical lab course in biology for non–majors offered by Ambry Bryce College to see how the Teaching Goals Inventory led to them.

Develop an ability to draw reasonable inferences from observations of the natural world. The wording of this outcome is identical to Item #4 in the Teaching Goals Inventory, except for the added phrase, “of the natural world.” When their responses on the Teaching Goals Inventory were collated, the five members of the Curriculum Committee were unanimous in rating this as their most important objective in the new course. 
 
Develop an ability to apply principles of biology to social issues.  This general learning outcome originated with Item #28 from the Inventory: “Develop an informed concern about contemporary social issues.” Four of the five committee members rated this goal as essential on the Inventory, but the fifth person pointed out that the original language did not really fit with the empirical spirit of biology. After some debate, the group settled on the revised statement.

Gain an understanding of the role of technology in human health. This outcome was inspired by Item #33 of the Teaching Goals Inventory: “Develop an informed understanding of the role of science and technology.” The committee was split on this goal and could not reach a consensus. Eventually they decided the problem was that the wording of the original outcome was too vague; their students were extremely interested in how modern technological advances were going to affect their own health. So the committee drafted this entirely new outcome from scratch. 

Learn major theories and principles of biology. This wording is similar to Item #18 in the Inventory: “Learn concepts and theories in this subject.” The committee was convened because the biology faculty felt their non–majors course was too fact laden, and not teaching useful thinking skills. However, all five members of the committee felt students still needed to learn at least some basic principles.

Attract more students to biology as a major. This goal is not listed on the Teaching Goals Inventory. It may seem strange to include this as a general learning outcome, but it is a legitimate one. A course designed to attract new majors presents fundamentally different design issues than does a course for students who have already committed to biology. 

The Teaching Goals Inventory helps the course developer select general learning outcomes, but which specific concepts should be emphasized in a course or curriculum, and which ones can be left out? This debate can be extremely contentious, even when just two faculty members are involved. Khodor (2004) developed the Biology Concept Framework (BCF) as a way to help course planners prioritize content material to enhance teaching and learning. To quote:

  “Our BCF is hierarchical, places details in context, nests related concepts, and articulates concepts that are inherently obvious to experts but often difficult for novices to grasp. Our BCF is also cross–referenced, highlighting interconnections between concepts. We have found our BCF to be a versatile tool for design, evaluation, and revision of course goals and materials. There has been a call for creating Biology Concept Inventories, multiple-choice exams that test important biology concepts, analogous to those in physics, astronomy, and chemistry. We argue that the community of researchers and educators must first reach consensus about not only what concepts are important to test, but also how the concepts should be organized and how that organization might influence teaching and learning. We think that our BCF can serve as a catalyst for community–wide discussion on organizing the vast number of concepts in biology, as a model for others to formulate their own BCFs and as a contribution toward the creation of a comprehensive BCF.”

Khodor’s framework can accessed online at http://web.mit.edu/bioedgroup/HBCF/CBE-Summer2004.htm. Developers can use the original version as a guide when discussing content priorities, or develop their own concepts framework instead. 



GENERAL PRINCIPLES
1.  Good assessment helps students develop as learners.
Assessment should be integrated into every step in the learning process. Students do not truly know what they have learned until they are assessed. Students NEED assessments to correct flawed thinking or misconceptions. Also, assessment tells students what we as their teachers value, and what we expect from them as learners. 

2.  Good assessment is both varied and frequent.
Each assessment method tells us something about student learning, but not all methods tell us the same things. Each assessment method has its strengths, limitations, and best uses. Using just one method limits the data collected, so limits what questions we can answer about learners. Using a variety of assessment methods expands our understanding of our student population’s learning paths. By assessing frequently, we know whether students are going in the direction we expect and want.

3.  Good assessment focuses on learning goals and outcomes.
Our goal as teachers is not to separate students according to skills or knowledge. It is to guide and coach students through the process that we ourselves went through. Assessing random knowledge only tells us which students can remember random knowledge. For every assessment activity, we should be able to explain explicitly how it helps students reach our general learning outcomes.

4. Good assessment is authentic.
If we want students to develop life-long learning skills, we need to assess them in ways that are meaningful in real-life situations. For example, if we expect students to learn technical writing skills, then we need to assess their technical writing in ways that resemble how technical writing of working professionals is evaluated. 

DIAGNOSTIC AND  INFORMAL ASSESSMENT
By definition, informal (also called formative) assessment is not used for grading students. It is how we determine the accuracy and depth of what students are learning while instruction is in progress. Its purpose is to:
•	Provide students with frequent constructive feedback about their learning so they can correct mistakes earlier rather than later.
•	Identify when and where an individual student needs help.

Informal assessments we use regularly are described below. Others are added as needed.




Principle 5: Frequent informal feedback promotes deeper learning.
Frequent informal (also called low-stakes or formative) feedback is one of the most reliable ways to increase learning accuracy, and foster deeper, longer-lasting learning. Informal assessment exposes misunderstandings and knowledge gaps so they can be corrected before a formal assessment. Repeated informal assessment also serves the same function as asking questions (described in Principle 1). Just as a coach for any physical activity identifies and corrects improper technique, informal assessment exposes misunderstandings and knowledge gaps so they can be corrected.

Principle 6: Lifelong learning requires skills students learn through intentional training and coaching.
Metacognition, that is, conscious attention and management of one’s own learning process and progress, improves learning outcomes. That said, most learners do not know what the metacognitive approach to learning is, let alone how to enact it. This is compounded by what can be called the “skills osmosis fallacy.” (Lay out the fallacy quickly here).

Best learning practices, including metacognition, are gained through conscious training, a process colloquially called “brain training.” The sports metaphor is surprisingly apt here. Although the biological processes differ between mental and physical performance, the underlying principle is the same when a sports coach trains elite athletes. By having them perform key actions repeatedly in practice (informal assessment), well in advance of an important competition (exam), the coach (instructor) identifies and corrects improper technique (knowledge errors), until the individual can perform reliably at or near peak ability. 

 
Principle 7: Learning is reinforced when students work and learn collaboratively. 
Collaborative work translates many of the preceding principles into practice. 
•	Students in high-functioning collaborative groups provide positive reinforcement and ask one another questions rather than simply making factual statements.
•	Collaboration engages multiple sensory modalities and encourages broader interconnection.
•	Members of collaborative groups often rely on the others to ask questions and fill knowledge gaps. As near peers they have similar processing strategies so are more likely to understand where their learning has stalled.
•	Groups can adapt to the needs of their members without threatening course structure.
•	Informal questions by group members are adaptive and asynchronous.
•	Group members coach each other.


Principle 8: Authentic experiences and assessments produce the deepest, longest-lasting learning gains.
