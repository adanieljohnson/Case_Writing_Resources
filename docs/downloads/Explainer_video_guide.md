# Final Project:  Explainer Video

## Overview

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is more than just our source of research funding for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. NSF has an official  US Congressional mandate to promote and support improvement in STEM education and literacy. This includes formal schooling from kindergarten through graduate school (and beyond), informal settings (museums and public spaces), and public policy. Congress also expects NSF to be able to demonstrate to the public that the taxpayers' dollars are being spent wisely.

One of the ways that NSF evaluates its outreach is requiring all grant applicants to explain in non-specialist language what the potential Broader Impacts are of their research. NSF grantees must provide a written statement of how they plan to leverage their research so it has an impact beyond just generating new knowledge.

Many NSF-funded scientists meet their Broader Impacts requirement by creating teaching materials focused on their research topic. A lot of the videos you see on YouTube that explain specialized science topics in simpler ways were made for this reason. These "explainer videos" have been a huge help to millions of students in STEM courses.

Your team will make a video (5-10 minutes) that explains a cell and molecular biology that you wanted to learn more about, but we did not get to explore during class.

If your team wants a more creative way to apply what you have learned, if you have a topic you want to find out more about, or if your team wants to learn a new skill, this option would be a good choice.


## What Do I Mean By An “Explainer” Video?

Your video will be about a topic we did not really explore in class, but it is not a video lecture. I don’t want you to just write on a whiteboard and film it.  Your video should capture the attention of someone who does not know the concept, and either make them want to learn more, or help them see why a process or mechanism is important. Think TED talks (but not so perfectly produced), not Kahn Academy.

Explainer videos can be one or a mix of styles:

* __Big Picture.__ This style does not go into small details. It summarizes the highlight points of a topic: what it is, how it works, why it is important we understand it. These are examples:
    + [Five Ways to Explain CRISPR Gene Editing](https://youtu.be/sweN8d4_MUg)
    + [Why Can’t We Make New Stradivari Violins?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOtQQRf0Fzc)
* __So What?__ This style emphasizes why a topic or process is important. Think about it like a video advertisement for that topic. Here are some examples:
    + [Why Is CRISPR Editing Revolutionary?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PU5bCflzEM)
    + [Gene Drives Can Change a Species Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI_OhvOumT0)
* __Demonstration.__ Think about how I demonstrate a process in class using props and everyday objects. Your video would be a more polished version of a visual demo. It can be 1-2 people on camera, or no one. Examples:
    + [How to Make Demo Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxfz3v-Q09U)
    + [How To See Germs Spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5-dI74zxPg)
* Case Study. This style of video introduces a concept VERY briefly, then shows a situation or example where it is important or plays a role.
    + [Lying With Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E91bGT9BjYk)
    + [Fairness in Animal Behavior](https://youtu.be/3XXQMDGErL0)

## What Are Some Topics We Won't Explore in Class?

You are not limited to these; they are examples to help you start thinking.

* Autophagy
* Apoptosis
* Nuclear skeleton
* Mitochondrial import and export
* Cell differentiation (stem cells, transit amplification)
* Unfolded protein response; chaperone functions
* Primary cilium (axis to organize cells in 3-D space)
* Exosomes (vesicles exchanged between cells)
* Nuclear receptor signaling
* ECM remodeling

 
## What Is Your Timeline?

Your team will have routine check-ins every couple of weeks to ensure you are making progress with the project. These are meant to help you stay on track, not add to your workload. Each check-in should require less than 20 minutes to complete. Most of your work time should be spent on moving the project itself towards completion.

* Week 6: Starting ideas. What are you thinking about?
* Week 8: What will you explain? What key points do you want to make?
* Week 10: Progress report.
* Week 12: Who contributed what to the project?


## Resources for Making an Explainer Video

### What Makes Explanations Good vs. Bad?

As part of the target audience for explainer videos, you likely have seen some very good explanations, and also some lousy videos that were poorly made, confusing, or plain boring to watch. Digital storytelling specialists have studied this problem, and developed guidelines for making better explainer videos. Some of the rules are the same as for traditional documentary filmmakers, but there also are some unique features. Many of the features of good videos are fairly obvious if you slow down, look closely at videos, and ask why it does or does not explain a concept well.

#### Example 1

I think this video illustrates several problems that explainer videos might have. It was an instant favorite with biology teachers when it was released ~15 years ago, and thousands of teachers have shown it in their classrooms. Yet the majority of student viewers did not like it. Any guesses why? Another question to consider: what is this video trying to explain?

#### Example 2

Which of these two videos explaining the SAME experiment on fairness in animal behavior do you think is more effective, and why?

* [Version 2](https://youtu.be/dKob6b8QzkU)


## Making Your Video

### Planning

This Word file is a basic planning template, links to resources, and suggestions for getting started. [Download Word file](downloads/Video_planning_1.docx)

I use this same document in my graduate course where we talk about making videos for teaching, so there may be some parts that are more advanced than what you want or need to use.

We also have great digital storytellers here on campus who can help you think about the process. Check with Digital Services in the library.


### Creating a Storyboard Outline

You do not HAVE to create a storyboard for a video, but it makes the process a LOT easier. I provided a couple examples of storyboards.

* (Example 1 of a storyboard)[downloads/Storyboard_1.docx]. Storyboard for a video teaching case on protein biology.
* (Example 2 of a storyboard)[downloads/Storyboard_2.docx]. Storyboard for a video for the 2019 NSF STEM Video Showcase. The video had to explain our research to a lay audience in under 3 minutes.


### Production

If you do not already have software for capturing and editing audio and video, I recommend these free programs:

* [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/) is an open-source video editing program. 
* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is an excellent audio capture and processing programs.
* [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/) is an open-source equivalent to MS Office. The Slides and Drawing programs are good for creating illustrations.

The University has a LOT of resources available for projects like this.
