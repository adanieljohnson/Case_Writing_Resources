# Case Goals

_What do you hope to accomplish or support with neuroscience teaching cases?_ 

There is no hard boundary b/w the listed goals; cases can support both immediate and longer-range goals simultaneously. Links after listed items connect to relevant resource pages.

* Within-Course Goals
    + Content & concepts mastery
        - Develop skills in R (or any specific knowledge domain) [(Link)](URL)
    + Basic disciplinary skills:
        - Reading skills [(Link)](URL)
        - Finding, summarizing reliable evidence [(Link)](URL)
        - Interpreting data [(Link)](URL)
    + Applied thinking (aka, transfer) skills [(Link)](URL)
        - Integrate and apply content to new situations [(Link)](URL)
        - Evidence-based decision-making [(Link)](URL)

* Metacognitive Goals
    + Taking ownership of learning [(Link)](URL)
    + Team building/student cohesion [(Link)](URL)
    + Tolerance for ambiguity [(Link)](URL)

* Cross-Cutting Goals
    + Collaborative problem solving [(Link)](URL)
    + Project management skills [(Link)](URL)
    + Increased retention [(Link)](URL)

* Professional development
    + Teacher & TA training [(Link)](URL)

# Implementation Barriers

_What implementation barriers or challenges do you expect to encounter, or would keep you from using cases?_

Links after bulleted items go to project pages addressing these challenges.

* In the class itself
    + Freeloaders/social loafing [(Link)](URL)
    + Cheating, sharing across semesters [(Link)](URL)
    + Student discomfort with non-lecture format [(Link)](URL)
    + How to provide constructive feedback [(Link)](URL)

* Outside/beyond the class
    + Do I know enough to write cases on topics outside of my expertise? [(Link)](URL)
    + Students giving lower ratings on course evaluations [(Link)](URL)

# Case Formats

_What case formats would be most engaging, appropriate for neuroscience teaching cases?_

Cases can be:

* Text vs. video based
* Historical/clinical vs. narrative
* Scenario vs. data 
* ??
* 
* 

A general outline of different case types and formats [is here](https://adanieljohnson.github.io/NTC2023/FAQ.html). For a more in-depth review, [download this handout.](https://adanieljohnson.github.io/NTC2023/downloads/NTC23_Case_Workshop_Handout_v1.docx) Examples of different case formats are in the [case collection](https://adanieljohnson.github.io/NTC2023/archive_overview.html).
