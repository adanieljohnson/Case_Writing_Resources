Before you start writing your own cases, take time to think about WHY you want to use them, and HOW you can best use them. When you have a general idea of what you want to do, use the ADDIE model to refine your plan and start building your personal case set.

# Case Goals

_What do you hope to accomplish or support with your teaching cases?_ 

Cases can support both immediate and longer-range goals simultaneously; the listed goals are a starting point for discussion. 

* Within-Course Goals
    + Content & concepts mastery
        - Example: develop skills in R (or any specific knowledge domain) 
    + Basic disciplinary skills:
        - Ex. reading skills 
        - Ex. finding, summarizing reliable evidence 
        - Ex. interpreting data 
    + Applied thinking (aka, transfer) skills 
        - Ex. integrate and apply content to new situations 
        - Ex. evidence-based decision-making 

* Metacognitive Goals
    + Ex. taking ownership of learning 
    + Ex. team building/student cohesion

* Cross-Cutting Goals
    + Ex. collaborative problem solving 
    + Ex. project management skills
    + Ex. increased retention

* Professional development
    + Ex. teacher & TA training

# Implementation Barriers

_What implementation barriers or challenges do you expect to encounter, or would keep you from using cases?_

Links after bulleted items go to project pages addressing these challenges.

* In the class itself
    + Ex. freeloaders/social loafing
    + Ex. cheating, sharing across semesters [(Link)](URL)
    + Ex. student discomfort with non-lecture format [(Link)](URL)
    + Ex. how to provide constructive feedback [(Link)](URL)

* Outside/beyond the class
    + Ex. do I know enough to write cases on topics outside of my expertise? [(Link)](URL)
    + Ex. students giving lower ratings on course evaluations [(Link)](URL)

# Case Formats

_What case formats would be most engaging, appropriate for my teaching cases?_

For example, cases can be:

* Text vs. video based
* Historical/clinical vs. narrative
* Scenario vs. data 
* 
* 
* 

A general outline of different case types and formats [is here](https://adanieljohnson.github.io/case-writing-resources/FAQ.html). For a more in-depth review, [download this handout.](https://adanieljohnson.github.io/case-writing-resources/downloads/NTC23_Case_Workshop_Handout_v1.docx) Examples of different case formats are in the [case collection](https://adanieljohnson.github.io/case-writing-resources/archive_overview.html).
