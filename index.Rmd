# Welcome

You found the support site for Dr. A. Daniel Johnson's presentation, _“Using problem-oriented discussion cases to develop neuroscience students’ thinking skills,”_ at the 2023 Neuroscience Teaching Conference.

#### \   

# What Is Here?

I've posted materials from the presentation, supporting resources, and additional curated tools for case writing and implementation. The main navigation menu is at the top of each page. Headers within the current page are listed in the menu on the left side. 

Some curated resources may not be available to view on the web site, and require downloading.

# Why Use Cases?

Cases help students engage with topics more deeply and develop richer insights. They are not just for developing higher order thinking though; I use them in content-dense courses to strengthen students’ basic content knowledge too.

Cases are not a panacea though; they have benefits and drawbacks. Case-oriented courses require considerable development work behind the scenes. The instructor gives up their role as expert source and becomes a thinking coach instead. They must think quickly and be ready to adapt new cases in real time.

# Who Am I?

I am a Teaching Professor of Biology at Wake Forest University. I wrote and published my first formal teaching case in 2005. I have since written or co-written >35 cases for: non-majors general biology;  majors (first years to seniors); federally mandated research ethics courses; and our graduate TA training program. I've also reviewed cases for the National Clearinghouse for Case Studies Teaching in Science (NCCSTS).
