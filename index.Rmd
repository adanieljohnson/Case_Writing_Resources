## This is the Landing Page

This is your home page for your website. Customize it as much as you would like, but keep it brief.

You can use this page to introduce what you are doing and your aims.


## General Structure

This template provides a starting form for your website. These pages already exist.

- **course_notes.Rmd** - List of pages being outlined.

- **pre_work.Rmd** - Use this as a scratchpad for testing.

- **project.Rmd** - As you might have guessed, use this section to write up your project

- **library.bib** - is text file that is available for you to put citations. You can then use these citations in the other Rmd documents. Also note that if you want to cite a package and want the bibtex you can do this by using the command `citation("packagename")`.

- **footer.html** - Go ahead and put your name in there!
The structure of the website can be changed by manipulating the `_site.yml` file. 

Font Awesome icons are available to use. You can check those out [here](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/).


When you are happy with what you have written for the day, go ahead and make a website out of it by using the following command in the console `rmarkdown::render_site()`
