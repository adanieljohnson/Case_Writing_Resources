# Welcome

You found the support site for Dr. A. Daniel Johnson's presentation, "\--", at the 2023 Neuroscience Teaching Conference.

#### \   

# What Is Available?

Materials from the presentation, supporting resources, as well as additional curated tools for case writing and implementation are listed in the live menu at the top of each page. Headers within the current page are listed in the menu on the left side. 

Some curated resources may not be directly accessible via the web site, and require downloading.

# Why Use Cases?

Cases help students engage with topics more deeply and develop richer insights. They are not just for developing higher order thinking though; I use them in content-dense courses to strengthen studentsâ€™ basic content knowledge too.

Cases are not a panacea though; they have benefits and drawbacks. Case-oriented courses require considerable development work behind the scenes. The instructor gives up their role as expert source and becomes a thinking coach instead. They must think quickly and be ready to adapt new cases in real time.

# Who Am I?

I wrote and published my first formal teaching case in 2005. I have since written or co-written >35 cases for non-majors general biology courses; courses for majors (first years to seniors); federally mandated research ethics courses; and our graduate TA training program.
