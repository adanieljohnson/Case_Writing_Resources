# Goals for Design and Development

Data from the __Analysis__ step tells you what students already know and can do (or not.) The next steps are to:

1. Design a strategy that moves students move beyond their current state of understanding or skills level, and
2. Develop the resources that you and the students will need to enact the strategy you have designed.

The design and development phase is when instructors have the most opportunities to be creative. Yet in practice, many fall back on well-worn instructional methods like exams, research papers, and in-class presentations. Do not be afraid to try out alternative strategies for:

* Engaging students' thinking about novel problems;
* Giving students opportunities to practice desired skills;
* Gauging student mastery or ability to use the skills required by the course design.
