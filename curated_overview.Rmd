The case resources are organized around a modified ADDIE model of curriculum design (U. Florida, 1975), with elements of backwards design (Wiggins & McTighe, 1999) that allow for more flexible, iterative design and revision.

# Analysis

1. General learning outcomes. What principles, theories, concepts, skills, or content knowledge should students achieve as a result of learning activities?

2. Specific benchmarks or performance goals. What will students be able to do to indicate they have accomplished these endpoints?

3. Sequencing. Which benchmarks do students need to reach first, before they can achieve others?


#### \   

# Design & Development

1. What activities, scenarios, or problems will allow or best help students reach the benchmarks?  

2. How will the learning activities from #1 be incorporated into a general case format?

3. What additional information or resources will students or the instructor need for the case?

#### \   

# Implementation 

How will: 

1. The case and related materials be delivered?

2. Students complete and submit case work and assessments?

3. The instructor provide support for the case in progress? Adjust or modify the case? Guide students through the process?
