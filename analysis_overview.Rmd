The case resources are organized around a modified ADDIE model of curriculum design (U. Florida, 1975), with elements of backwards design (Wiggins & McTighe, 1999) that allow for more flexible, iterative design and revision.

# Goals of Analysis

The first step in the ADDIE process is to determine what specific goals you hope to accomplish in a course. More specifically:

1. __General learning outcomes.__ What principles, theories, concepts, skills, or content knowledge should students achieve as a result of learning activities?
2. __Specific benchmarks or performance goals.__ What will students be able to do to indicate they have accomplished these endpoints?
3. __Sequencing.__ Which benchmarks do students need to reach first, before they can achieve others?
