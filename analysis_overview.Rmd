# Goals of Analysis

The first step in the ADDIE process is to determine what specific goals you hope to accomplish in a course. More specifically:

1. __What are the general learning outcomes?__ What principles, theories, concepts, skills, or content knowledge should students achieve as a result of learning activities?
2. __What are appropriate specific benchmarks or performance goals?__ What will students be able to do to indicate they have accomplished these endpoints?
3. __How should the goals be sequenced?__ Which benchmarks do students need to reach first, before they can achieve others?
