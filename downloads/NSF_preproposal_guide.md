# Final Project: NSF Pre-Proposal

## Overview

By the end of the semester you will have demonstrated your mastery of a great deal of factual information and your thinking skills via the the 4 exams, homework, and cases. The final team project is an opportunity to put what you have learned to work. Depending on what you choose to do, the final team project is an opportunity to explore a topic that we did not get to this semester, or to use what you have learned to understand an open question, break down a challenge, or solve a cell biology-related problem.

Your team will decide on a specific question or challenge related to cell and molecular biology that you want to explore, that brings together and CONNECTS at least two different areas of cell biology we have explored. You will design a strategy to address a specific question or challenge, and write a 3-page pre-proposal letter to the NSF requesting funding to support the project.

I designed this assignment to be very close to how we as professionals apply for grant funding. If you want to start developing this important professional skill, this would be a good final project option to choose.


## What Exactly IS an NSF Pre-Proposal?

The [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) (NSF) is one of biologists’ main sources of grant funding for research; other big funding agencies are National Institutes of Health (NIH), US Dept. of Agriculture (USDA), and Dept. of Defense (DOD). Several private foundations and charities also provide a great deal of funding.

Writing a full NSF grant proposal takes several months and rate of success is very low; only ~5% of grants are funded, and when the federal budget is tight, the rate is even lower.

To save investigators’ time, NSF and other agencies may ask teams to submit a pre-proposal letter outlining their project ~4 months before the full grant deadline. The pre-proposal letter is reviewed by the program officers at the agency to determine:

* Is the project within the scope of what Congress has said that agency can fund?
* Is the project looking at an interesting or important question?
* Does the project team have a good strategy and specific methods to help them answer their question? Is there supporting literature to show:
    + Their plan is based on good prior studies and principles; and
    + They can complete the project successfully?
* Relative costs and benefits.
    + Will the outcome of the project have direct, measurable benefits to STEM disciplines, the general public, or both? Are those benefits clearly laid out?
    + Is the budget requested reasonable given the work that the team plans to do?
    + Is there a compelling reason to fund this project over some other project?

Based on the pre-proposal letter, the Program Officer decides whether or not the project is strong enough to justify the time for a full proposal and review. Only investigators who pass this first hurdle get to submit a full proposal.


## What Kinds of Projects Can You Propose?

Below are examples of practical, integrative, and applied cell/molecular biology problems or challenges. For some I have suggested a particular approach to solving the problem or experimental design options. Others I have left open-ended. __These are not your only options__, just ideas to help your team start thinking, and help you get into the right mindset. If you have an idea and you are unsure it fits the project, pitch the raw idea to me as soon as you can.

* Cellular strategies to mitigate monkeypox infection or progression. Your project might focus on:
    + Blocking virus entry, signaling, or life cycle
    + Changing cell responses to infection, or improving clearance
    + Testing gene therapies or drug-able targets
* Using cellular stress responses as biomarkers for environmental quality. You might adapt parts of:
    + Transcriptional reporter assays
    + Cell signaling assays
    + Cell reorganization responses
* Design a next generation antibiotic for a NOVEL target not currently used. A project like this lets you bring in:
    + Cell replication, transcription, translation
    + Prokaryotic cell functions that do not occur in eukaryotes.
    + A drug discovery process similar to the case on translation inhibitors.
* A cell-based approach to treating or correcting a rare/orphan disease state.
    + [NIH’s guide and list of rare/orphan diseases]() 
    + National database of rare diseases
* A cellular bio-engineering or cell biology-inspired solution to a practical challenge. For example:
    + Using an existing or modified form of collagen to 3-D print replacements for intervertebral discs.
    + Using proteins anchored to artificial membranes that can desalinate water. 


## Your Timeline

Your team will have routine check-ins every couple of weeks to ensure you are making progress with the project. These are meant to help you stay on track, not add to your workload. Each check-in should require less than 20 minutes to complete. Most of your work time should be spent on moving the project itself towards completion.

* Class Week 6: Starting ideas. What are you thinking about?
* Class Week 8: What is your pre-proposal targeting? What are your starting resources?
* Class Week 10: Progress report.
* Class Week 12: Who contributed what to the project?

You should be able to complete your project before final exams week. __Tip:__ work steadily on your pre-proposal; I can spot last-minute work, and the grades on these usually are not good.


## Format and Content Requirements

My requirements for this assignment are based on the National Science Foundation's guidelines. Your pre-proposal document will have 2 sections.

### Section 1: The Project Outline

You are limited to 3 pages, Calibri, Times, or Arial font, no smaller than 10 points, single spaced. This section will have:

1. A brief Lay Summary describing the entire project, in one paragraph. 
    + This paragraph spells out the general goals and specific aims. Think of it as an abstract of the rest of the document. 
    + Limit is 200 words. 
    + It should be understandable by a college-educated NON-scientist.

2. A Background section. This part will describe or provide:
    + Specific question or challenge your team is exploring;
    + Why this is an interesting or important question; and
    + Sufficient context for the project to make sense to another biologist.
    + Central concepts will need to be backed up with literature citations (use Harvard's Name, Year format for in-text citations).

3. An Approach section. 
    + Here is where you describe the strategy you plan to use to start addressing the question or challenge you explained in the Background. 
    + Think of it like the Methods and predicted Results sections of a lab report. 
    + This part will have:
        - Citations (use Harvard's Name, Year format for in-text citations) showing your plan is based on prior literature;
        - SHORT explanations of any specialized techniques or methods that are not generally known or used by biologists; and
        - If you can make predictions about what you might observe, what you expect to see and why.

4. A Justification, Risks & Benefits section. Here is where your describe:
    + What direct, measurable benefits the proposed project will have for STEM disciplines and/or the general public the project will produce; and
    + If known, any factors that could prevent the project from being completed as described.

### Section 2: Supporting Materials

You are limited to 3 pages. Again, text should be Calibri, Times, or Cambria font, no smaller than 10 points, single spaced. This section has:

5. A list of __Cited Sources__ (please use APA format), and as appropriate, supporting photos, charts, figures, tables. This part is limited to 2 pages.

6. A Contributions section describing what each team member contributed to the project. 
    + This section is limited to 1 page. 
    + Yes, we DO have to do this for grants. It is part of our budget justification.


## Example of a Pre-Proposal

I will post an example of a pre-proposal until after you submit your initial project idea, so that you can think as broadly as possible. When it is posted, you can download it from the LMS.


## Resources for Writing Your Pre-Proposal

### Examples of Lay Summaries

This search list of funded NSF grant proposals will give you an idea of the language for your summary of the project. Focus on the abstracts of individual projects.

### Zotero

If you are not already using reference management software I recommend learning to use Zotero. It is free, has a very large user community, is supported by almost every library, and your account is yours forever. Zotero lets you store and organize PDFs, Word files, image files, etc., by connecting them to their reference. Automated data entry makes it easy to build a bibliography.
