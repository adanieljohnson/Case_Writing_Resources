# Generic Start of Semester Survey

I ask students to complete this survey in all courses where I use cases. The survey is posted to the course LMS, and scored as a completion assignment. From this I know:

* Topics most likely to engage students quickly (Qus. 2, 3)
* What topics may need supplemental materials (Qu. 4)
* Which students are likely to speak up vs. be quiet in discussions (Qus. 5, 6)
* Which students to combine to make teams that have diverse interests and complementary skills (Qus. 3-5)
* Which students are unlikely to work well together, or to struggle in a team (Qu. 6)


## Text of the Survey

This survey will help me assign you to your working teams for the semester. You get full credit as long as you complete it.
 
1. What is your name? Is there a nickname or something you prefer to be called?

2. Why did you decide to take this class? What interests you about it? What are you hoping to learn from it?

3. What previous topics or classes in biology did you find most interesting, or you especially liked?

4. What previous topics or classes in biology did you find most difficult, challenging, or confusing?


High-performing teams have a mix of different personalities that approach questions and problems in different ways. I will not have enough time to decide for myself what kind of team member each of you is likely to be. Fortunately for me, there are shortcuts.

5. Team Building Shortcut A: 

Past behavior is one good predictor for how you will contribute to a team. Tell me which description is closest to how you usually behave during a group discussion or project. Assume it is a topic/project you know and care about.

__I like to brainstorm and think out loud.__ Talking about what I know or think helps me process it and put the pieces together. I prefer to hear what other people are thinking as they are thinking about it, rather than wait for them to make a complex argument I have to take apart again.

__I prefer to give and take.__ I like to wait until I have something substantial to say. I will speak up when I have a fact or piece of information that is relevant, but I prefer to share well thought-out responses or a complete argument rather than thinking aloud. If I do not speak up I’m probably still thinking.

__I like to stew on it.__ I like to listen, and take everything in. I will rarely speak unless asked directly. I may not know what I think about facts and issues right away, but I will continue to think about them long after the discussion ends. (FYI, stewpots sometimes tell me they prefer to express their thoughts by writing or creating something rather than talking.)

__I like playing the Devil’s advocate.__ I will take the opposite side of any argument, even if it is not what I actually think myself, just so all sides are considered. I sometimes even work out problems by having arguments with myself.
 

6. Team Building Shortcut B: 

Most of us tend to approach new problems or tasks in a particular way. Good teams have people with a mix of initial approaches. Also I want to AVOID partnering people whose approaches I know interfere with each other. Tell me: which of these descriptions sounds most like you? (Animal names are just for fun!)

__I am a Tracker/Coyote.__ I will look around, then quickly pick up on one idea and see where it goes. I will keep following it even when it gets hard to track. When I get interested in one idea, sometimes I overlook or pass by something obvious, but only because I am still following or thinking about that earlier idea.

__I am a Digger/Groundhog.__ I dig in and look for all the details. I am not satisfied otherwise. I am good at finding information, but sometimes I spend so much time digging for information that I run out of time to connect the pieces together.

__I need the Big Picture/Crow.__ I have to see a general overview of everything first. I need to get a sense of a larger task or problem, and how the parts and issues connect together. I am good at summarizing situations, but I can have a hard time focusing on details.

__I am a Sampler/Bumblebee.__ I pick up many random bits of information about a problem, then put them together into a story. To others it looks random or chaotic, and usually it does not even make sense to me at first. I know when a resource will be useful or pay off, I just cannot explain how until the end.

__I am a Soloist/House Cat.__ I have a hard time working on problems with others. It is hard for me to get into a problem by discussing it with a group. Getting and holding my attention is hard, so give me a task of my own, then leave me alone to do it.
