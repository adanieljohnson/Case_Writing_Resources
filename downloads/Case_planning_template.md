# A Starting Template For Developing a Case

If you write cases regularly, you develop a workflow that works for you. Until then, or if you have been away from case writing for a while, it helps to have a starting template. The one below will help you assemble the essential first pieces while still leaving plenty of room for creativity.

## 1.  Goals and Topic

What 1-2 learning goals do you want this case to achieve? Be specific. Use action verbs to state the goals.

* 
* 

What topic do you want to make your case about? WHY use that topic?

* 


## 2.  Scenario

What story or situation that is relevant or familiar to students would require them to use or demonstrate the knowledge or skills that are contained in your learning goals?
 
* Can you break the story up into segments with separate goals?
* Can you organize the scenario so it contains an “and-but-so” conflict or problem?
* What visuals or artifacts could help bring the story to life for students?


## 3.  Guide Questions and Supports

What initial questions can you ask students about this scenario that will require them to use a particular thinking strategy or apply a particular set of skills? If they do not have those skills yet, what questions would you ask to lead them through that process? 

Ideally your questions:

* Are open-ended (no clear single best answer)
* Can be discussed, explored in a small group of 2-6 students
* Require higher order thinking skills (no simple answers)
* Get students to think or act in ways that fit the learning goals

What is the MINIMUM amount of supporting information they need? How much would overwhelm them?

What follow-up questions can you ask that require students to apply or extend what they have learned in the discussion? Ideally these questions:

* Require using or building on the initial information surfaced by the first set of questions
* At least partly “close the loop”
* Get students to think or act in ways that fit the learning goals


## 4.  Outputs

How are you going to ask students to provide responses to questions or feedback?

* Show of hands
* Group reporter
* Color cards
* Electronic poll
* Clickers

What will be your students’ deliverables that you will grade?

* Team items
* Individual items


## 5.  Logistics

What is you plan for running the case?

* How will you introduce the case?
* What size groups will you have? Self-selected or assigned?
* How long do you want the case to take?
* How will you close out the scenario, and move to the next topic?

What is your plan for WHEN things go astray?

* How can you shorten the case if time runs out?
* What technology do you need that could fail?
* What is your Plan B if students don’t “get it”?


## Refining Your Case

Once you have a skeleton for the case, wait a day or so before doing more. Pitch it to a colleague and 1-2 students to see what they think. 

* If you still like your initial idea after hearing their responses, start filling in the details.
* If you are not happy with your idea or how it was received, do not throw it out. Put it into a __Raw Ideas__ folder and revisit it at another time.
