Cases in this collection were selected to: 1) illustrate the range of case formats and variety of skills that students can build using cases; and 2) provide student-tested templates for writing new cases.

Some cases have aged out so cannot be used in their current form, but they still exemplify good case structures and organization strategies. Their basic frameworks can be updated with new content or used for a new case on a different topic. 

Case titles marked "N" explore topics specifically relevant to neuroscience.

Using feedback from 2023 NTC attendees as a starting point I hope to add more templates and examples illustrating other case formats.

## Legend 

Cases are classified by:

* __Format__: single- or multiple sessions case; continuous or interrupted. Linked sets are 2+ cases using the same background information. 
* __Time required__ (excluding outside reading, research)
* __Focus or key activities__ build:
    + Content and conceptual knowledge, general knowledge, and/or discipline-specific knowledge
    + Critical, applied, or synthetic thinking skills
    + Practical skills: experimental design, interpreting data, summarizing observations, reporting preliminary work
    + Affective and metacognitive skills: self- reflection, strategic thinking, team or process assessment
* __Level of difficulty__: 
    + Nonmajors
    + Introductory (100-level courses)
    + Intermediate (200-/300-level courses)
    + Advanced (senior undergraduates, graduate students)
* __Instructor notes__: 
    + Yes. Case includes full instructorâ€™s notes
    + Partial. Case notes are incomplete or in draft form
    + None. Only the case scenario and student materials are available currently
