Cases in this collection were selected to: 1) illustrate the range of case formats and variety of skills that students can build using cases; and 2) provide templates that have been tested already with students.

Some of the cases have aged out as their fields have progressed, so cannot be used as they are currently. Still they are good examples of specific case structures and organization strategies. The basic frameworks can be updated by overlaying new content or a different topic. 

Using feedback from 2023 NTC attendees as a starting point I hope to add more templates and examples illustrating other specific case strategies.

## Legend 

Cases are classified by:

* __Format__: single- or multiple sessions case; continuous or interrupted. Linked sets are 2+ cases using the same background information. 
* __Time required__ (excluding outside reading, research)
* __Focus or key activities__ build:
    + Content and conceptual knowledge, general knowledge, and/or discipline-specific knowledge
    + Critical, applied, or synthetic thinking skills
    + Practical skills: experimental design, interpreting data, summarizing observations, reporting preliminary work
    + Affective and metacognitive skills: self- reflection, strategic thinking, team or process assessment
* __Level of difficulty__: 
    + Nonmajors
    + Introductory (100-level courses)
    + Intermediate (200-/300-level courses)
    + Advanced (senior undergraduates, graduate students)
* __Instructor notes__: 
    + Yes. Case includes full instructorâ€™s notes
    + Partial. Case notes are incomplete
    + None. Only the case scenario and student materials are available currently
