## Grading Case Assignments

I grade all case-related assignments using a bins-based model (also called specifications grading.) Items are scored on a 5-point scale based on __overall quality__:

5 = Exceptional. Complete, (equivalent to an A, or 95 in course grades)
4 = Acceptable. Complete, with some minor errors but essentially correct; accurate, acceptable  (B, or 85)
3 = Needs improvement. Complete, but has significant errors in logic, reasoning, or interpretation (C or 75)
2 = Seriously flawed. Submitted but incomplete, with multiple basic factual errors. (D or 65)
0 = Not submitted. (F or 0)

I also sometimes use a 10-point scale, which students seem to prefer, but when I compared the two, overall course grades were no different when using the finer grained 10-point scale vs. the 5-point scale. 

Most of my grading time is spent giving written feedback to individuals and teams that focuses on whether they have met my expectations, what they did well, and how to improve next time. I limit comments to the 3 most important suggestions per assignment; students struggle to internalize more than that.

Besides being faster, bins scoring means there are no points to argue for. When individuals or teams come in for meetings we are more productive because we focus on the gaps in their knowledge or thinking.
