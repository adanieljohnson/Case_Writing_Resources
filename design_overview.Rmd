# Goals for Design and Development

The second step in the ADDIE process is to determine how best to help students achieve the specific goals established in the __Analysis__ stage. In practice, design and development transitions to revision and refinement as a case or course matures. 

Specific questions to ask in the Design and Development phase are:

1. What activities, scenarios, or problems will allow or best help students reach the benchmarks?  
2. How will the learning activities from #1 be incorporated into a general case format?
3. What additional information or resources will students or the instructor need for the case?
